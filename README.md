Introduction of Python Repository
Python repositories are defined as a database or storage where it will store libraries; packages, etc are developed in a python programming language which is also a process of managing packages in Python with the management tools such as pip or PyPI which are declared as public repositories with open source which is freely available for public. In general, the python repository is mainly a central memory or place where we are storing the data and managing these data using Python packages or libraries written in python language and this repository can be configured on any local machine or on a server which can be accessed by any multiple users.

Different Python Repositories in Python Programming Language
In this article, we are discussing Python repository which is the central storage for storing data and managing data using Python tools such as pip or PyPI which are public repositories that are written in a python programming language. These repositories in Python are the storage of packages or libraries or modules in Python programming language. In Python, there are various famous Python repositories and it also provides an option to create our repository which can be used in developing web and creating different applications that use machine learning, big data, data science, etc.

Now we will see PyPI a Python package Index in python repository which is also known as a cheese shop or a third party software repository for Python programming language. This PyPI repository is used for searching packages by applying filters against their metadata and also allows installing software or libraries or packages which are hosted by PyPI in the form of archives that are also called as source distribution or precompiled. The PyPI repository which has packages without incurring any repeated downloads will also take advantage of packages that are taken by the repository manager in the Python package index and which redirects it to decrease time and bandwidth which will later give high performance in accessing the packages in Python. This repository provides metadata that consists of HTML documents in which it includes the details or describes which packages are available along with package versions and in these HTML documents it will also provide a link to download the packages that are described in these documents. There is also another option other than HTML documents this repository metadata can be achieved or retrieved manually by using curl commands which can be further used for debugging any issues related to the PyPI Python repository.

Examples of Python Repository
Let us consider a sample example to get the packagecloud-test package which is in the PyPI repository and to download its metadata we can run with curl command as shown below:
Python Repository-1.1
In the above, we can see an HTML document that gives a link to download or install the packagecloud-test of Python which is a sample project.

Now let us see another repository known as pip which is also having a huge and variety of packages and libraries of Python programming languages that can be used in various codes for developing different types of applications. In Python, pip is one of the most recommended and widely used package management tool or repository as it has an amazing feature of eliminating the manual updates and installs of various packages that are available to different operating systems. This is also a repository where we get a complete list of a wide variety of packages available along with their version number provided to avoid the redundancy of various packages in the pip repository. In Python, we need to install the pip repository by following the guidelines provided in the installation documentation provided or in the recent versions of Python are having pip by default in the versions 3.4 and above.


By running the command “python get –pip.py” we can install the repository and if it is already present we can check it by seeing its version using “pip –version” This repository provides various commands for the developers for easy access of any packages available in the pip repository. Few commands are as shown below:

To install any packages from pip then we have to run the below command:

pip install package_name
Ex: pip install flask

Python Repository-1.2
In the above screenshot, we can see the installation of the “flask” package through the pip repository.


In the pip repository, we can also check the list of packages installed by running the “pip list” and if we want to see any particular details of any packages that are installed from pip then we can run command “pip show package_name_installed”. We can also uninstall any packages in the pip repository very easily by just running the command “pip uninstall package_name”. Therefore, there are many such commands listed in pip to make the developers easy to deal with this repository.

In Python, there are many such repositories provided other than pip and PyPI because these two are open source. Some of the other most famous repositories are Httpie for an HTTP client operation, Django web framework, Scikit Learn having machine learning framework, Pyspider for web crawler, Odoo for supporting e-commerce, etc. In Python, we can create our private repositories also.

Conclusion
In this article, we conclude that in Python the repository stands for a central place to store the data such as packages or libraries that are useful for the developers to develop various applications. In this article, we saw two main repositories which are widely used in Python programming languages such as PyPI and pip and these are also open-source and publicly available. In this article, we saw how PyPI and pip repositories can be used to fetch any packages from their respective repositories. In this article, we also saw a few commands related to pip repositories and we also saw other repositories in Python that are used by the developers.
